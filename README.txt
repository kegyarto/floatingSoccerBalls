This follows the theme because I have a character throw balls at particular floating soccer balls.
As I hit the soccer balls I get a point until I hit the balls forty times then the player wins.
Also, the trees make it feel as though the game is being played in a field.
The trees came from unity environment, soccer material came from the software on microsoft paint as 
I created the soccer ball with this. The other materials,bb8, the score, character controller, and target
code came from Professor Marai.
